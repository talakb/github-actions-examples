## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if someone is already working on similar changes
2. **Open an issue** to discuss your proposed changes if they're significant
3. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your changes

### Workflow Example Guidelines

When adding new workflow examples, please ensure they:

#### ‚úÖ Do Include:
- **Clear, descriptive names** for workflows and jobs
- **Comprehensive comments** explaining each step
- **Real-world scenarios** that developers actually encounter
- **Error handling** and proper status checks
- **Security best practices** (no hardcoded secrets, minimal permissions)
- **Cross-platform support** when applicable
- **Caching strategies** for dependencies and build artifacts

#### ‚ùå Avoid:
- Hardcoded secrets or sensitive information
- Overly complex examples that are hard to understand
- Workflows that only work in very specific environments
- Examples without proper documentation
- Duplicate functionality without clear differentiation

### Code Style and Standards

#### YAML Formatting
```yaml
# Use 2-space indentation
name: Example Workflow

# Always include helpful comments
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]  # Use square brackets for arrays
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# Use descriptive job names
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Clear step descriptions
      uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Pin to specific versions
      
    - name: Another step
      run: |
        echo "Use pipe for multi-line commands"
        echo "Include helpful output messages"
```

#### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Include practical examples
- Explain the "why" not just the "how"
- Add links to relevant documentation
- Use proper markdown formatting

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/github-actions-examples.git
cd github-actions-examples

# Create a new branch for your changes
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Add your workflow to the appropriate directory (`.github/workflows/`)
- Include comprehensive comments and documentation
- Test your workflow if possible
- Update the README.md to reference your new example

### 3. Test Your Workflow

Before submitting, please:

- **Validate YAML syntax** using a YAML linter
- **Test the workflow** in your own repository if possible
- **Check for security issues** (no secrets, appropriate permissions)
- **Verify documentation** is clear and accurate

```bash
# Test YAML syntax
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/your-workflow.yml'))"

# Or use yamllint if available
yamllint .github/workflows/your-workflow.yml
```

### 4. Submit Your Contribution

```bash
# Commit your changes with a descriptive message
git add .
git commit -m "Add workflow example for [specific use case]

- Describe what the workflow does
- Mention key features or techniques demonstrated
- Reference any issues this addresses"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a pull request on GitHub
```

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Setup environment
      # Include version and reasoning for choices
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
