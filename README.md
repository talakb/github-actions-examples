## üìÅ Sample Applications


The repository includes sample applications that you can use to test the workflows:

### [Node.js Sample App](/sample-apps/nodejs/)
- Simple Express-like application with functions to test
- Unit tests demonstrating testing patterns  
- Package.json with common npm scripts
- Demonstrates JavaScript/TypeScript workflow patterns

### [Python Sample App](/sample-apps/python/)

python3 test_app.py
```

## üèÅ Getting Started

### 1. Choose a Workflow
Browse the examples above and find one that matches your needs.

### 2. Copy to Your Repository
Create a `.github/workflows/` directory in your repository and copy the desired workflow file.

### 3. Customize
Modify the workflow to match your specific requirements:
- Update trigger conditions
- Change build steps
- Add your specific testing commands
- Configure secrets and environment variables

### 4. Test
Create a pull request or push to trigger the workflow and verify it works as expected.

## üìã Best Practices

### Security
- **Never commit secrets** - Use GitHub secrets for sensitive data
- **Use minimal permissions** - Specify only required permissions
- **Pin action versions** - Use specific versions like `actions/checkout@v4`
- **Validate inputs** - Always validate workflow inputs and parameters

### Performance
- **Use caching** - Cache dependencies and build artifacts
- **Parallel jobs** - Run independent jobs in parallel
- **Conditional execution** - Skip unnecessary steps with conditions
- **Artifact management** - Clean up old artifacts regularly

### Maintainability
- **Clear naming** - Use descriptive names for workflows and jobs
- **Documentation** - Comment complex logic and conditions
- **Modular design** - Break complex workflows into smaller, reusable pieces
- **Error handling** - Include proper error handling and notifications

### Example Security Configuration
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read    # Read repository contents
  issues: write     # Write to issues (for auto-labeling)
  pull-requests: write  # Write to PRs
```

### Example Caching Pattern
```yaml
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-node-
```

## üìñ Common Patterns

### Environment-based Deployment
```yaml
environment: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && 'production' || 'staging' }}
```

### File Change Detection
```yaml
- name: Check for changes
  uses: dorny/paths-filter@v2
  id: changes
  with:
    filters: |
      frontend:
        - 'src/**'
      backend:
        - 'api/**'
```

### Dynamic Matrix Generation
```yaml
jobs:
  setup:
    outputs:
      matrix: ${{ steps.set-matrix.outputs.matrix }}
    steps:
      - id: set-matrix
        run: echo "matrix=$(cat .github/matrix.json)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```
